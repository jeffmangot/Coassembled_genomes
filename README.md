Draft genomes of MAST-4 lineages obtained by a co-assembling strategy

## Description

Here are deposited two draft assemblies of two clades of MAST-4 (uncultured marine HF) resulting from the co-assembling of separately-sequenced SAGs belonging to the same species. It results draft assemblies estimated to cover around 68–74% of the genome of these two species.

These SAGs provied from 14 and 9 cells from MAST-4A and MAST-4E isolated during the Tara Oceans expedition.

The raw sequences of these two draft genomes are deposited here (including both contigs < and > 1kb).

The work resulting of the study of these two co-assembled genomes have been published in Mangot et al., Sci. Rep., 2017.
